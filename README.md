# Competitive audits portfolio

In here you will find the competitions that I've been part of, along with my findings.
I am always updating this whenever I am allowed to. If a competition is still ongoing auditors are not allowed to share "real-time" information.
Only after the competition is set and done, are we allowed to share our findings.
